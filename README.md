# Parser-Project

**Todo**
- Compile and run the sample projects for validity
- Create function for reading multiple files, given as many file names as wanted
- create function for creating symbol table
- create functin for the table translation
- create function for printing out the table









The program should be able to:
- write the token and lexemes found
- print out the production rules used for analyzing the token
    - Professor recommended having a print statement at the beginning of each functin
    - recommends having a switch statement with the print statement
    
    
IF syntax errors occur, parser should:
- generate a meaningful error message such as: 
    - token
    - lexeme
    - line number
    - error type
    - etc
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    TODO()
    
    
    - create makeTable() <- creates a symbol table 
    - translate() <- translates our table 
    - create printOut() <- main function responsble for the output shown by the prof
    - create readFile() <- make it be able to take as many arguments as needed
    - we need to figure out how to create a table from withing our Lexer class and then let that table be used by the parser class
    - more will be added
